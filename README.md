# Cadence-Competition
 September Competition from Emerald

 #Introduction#
 NBATopShot is a large project in the flow network. With a lot of daily sales is one of the most solid project inside the network. However, a lot interesting stuffs can be done there that could help people to do a bundle of task quickly and in the safest mode.

 This contract will help to add liquidity to your wallet

 ##The contract##
 Imagine you have a lot of moments and need some liquidity in your wallet. Think in try to sell off all your items in bundle, but this could take days, months or even years. You need money asap, and one thing about NBATS is there a lot of people offering money for the moments.

 With this contract you will be able to sell all your moments at the offer price. If the moment doesn´t have a valid offer, then you can list for sale in bundle.

 I´m using base code from Jacob-Tucker github (https://github.com/jacob-tucker/cadence-ideas), and only adding the new feature to the contract. This is my entry for the September Competition from Emerald
